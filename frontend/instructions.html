        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Take a look as we play the following video, pretending as if you are driving the car. If you perceive a dangerous situation, click on the red button (or hit the space bar); we will take a note of which part of the video that scenario corresponds to. This will help us greatly in our autonomous driving research study at the Whitney Laboratory here at UC Berkeley!</p>
        <p><i><strong>Loosely speaking, a "dangerous situation" is defined as one where you, as the driver, feel you need to take immediate action in order to avoid an accident</strong></i></p>
        <p>Today, you will watch a total of 10 videos, each approximately 10 seconds long.</p>
